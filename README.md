# Polynomial Time Solution for NP-Complete Decision Problems

This project implements a novel approach to solving NP-complete decision problems in polylog time, based on the research paper by Chelsea Anne McElveen.

## Overview

The core idea is to use innovative encoding and decoding functions to represent the solution space of NP-complete decision problems in a way that allows for polynomial time solutions. This approach transforms the traditionally exponential-time search space into a more manageable form.

## Key Concepts

### Permutation Function

The foundation of this approach is based on the permutation function:

P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!

Where:
- n is the total number of elements
- k is the number of elements being chosen

### Encoding Function

The encoding function maps an index value at a specific layer number to a unique value:

f(X, D) = (X / 2^D) - (D/2)

Where:
- X is the index value at a specific layer number
- D is the layer number

### Decoding Function

The decoding function retrieves the index value and layer number from a given encoded value:

f^(-1)(Y, D) = 2^D * (Y + D/2)

Where:
- Y is the encoded value
- D is the layer number

## Features

- Encode and decode values using the custom algorithm
- Generate the i-th permutation for given n and k values
- Reverse-engineer encoded values through multiple layers
- Solve NP-complete problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack Problem in polynomial time

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(1) for both encoding and decoding functions
- Space Complexity: O(1) for both encoding and decoding functions

This represents a significant improvement over traditional approaches, which often have exponential time and space complexities for NP-complete problems.

## Usage

[Include instructions on how to use the script, similar to the previous README]

## Applications

This approach can be applied to various NP-complete problems, including:

1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
2. Knapsack Problem
3. Graph Coloring
4. Hamiltonian Cycle Problem

## Future Work

- Extend the approach to other NP-complete problems
- Explore real-world applications in logistics, supply chain optimization, and network design
- Investigate integration with quantum computing
- Develop dedicated hardware to enhance performance
