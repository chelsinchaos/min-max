# Polynomial Time Solution for NP-Complete Decision Problems

This project implements a novel approach to solving NP-complete decision problems in polylog time, based on the research paper by Chelsea Anne McElveen.

## Overview

The core idea is to use innovative encoding and decoding functions to represent the solution space of NP-complete decision problems in a way that allows for polynomial time solutions. This approach transforms the traditionally exponential-time search space into a more manageable form.

## Key Concepts

### Permutation Function

The foundation of this approach is based on the permutation function:

P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!

Where:
- n is the total number of elements
- k is the number of elements being chosen

### Encoding Function

The encoding function maps an index value at a specific layer number to a unique value:

f(X, D) = (X / 2^D) - (D/2)

Where:
- X is the index value at a specific layer number
- D is the layer number

### Decoding Function

The decoding function retrieves the index value and layer number from a given encoded value:

f^(-1)(Y, D) = 2^D * (Y + D/2)

Where:
- Y is the encoded value
- D is the layer number

## Features

- Encode and decode values using the custom algorithm
- Generate the i-th permutation for given n and k values
- Reverse-engineer encoded values through multiple layers
- Solve NP-complete problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem and Knapsack Problem in polynomial time

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(1) for both encoding and decoding functions
- Space Complexity: O(1) for both encoding and decoding functions

This represents a significant improvement over traditional approaches, which often have exponential time and space complexities for NP-complete decision problems.

## Usage

# Set Generation and Reverse Engineering Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts and a c++ 17 .cpp file for each the min and max versions as well as one optimized with assembly for x86: one for generating a set of permutations and another for reverse engineering encoded values. Both scripts can be run from the command line and allow for customizable input parameters.

# Speedy.py

## Usage

Run the `speedy.py` script from the command line using the following format:

`python speedy.py -n <total_elements> -k <elements_in_permutation> [-csv <csv_file_path>] [values...]`

## Arguments

- **`-n:`** (Required) The total number of elements.  
  **Type:** `int`  
  **Example:** `-n 2`

- **`-k:`** (Required) The number of elements in the permutation.  
  **Type:** `int`  
  **Example:** `-k 16`

- **`-csv:`** (Optional) Path to the CSV file with values to use instead of generating them.  
  **Type:** `str`  
  **Example:** `-csv path/to/file.csv`

- **`values:`** (Optional) List of values to process if not provided in a CSV file.  
  **Type:** `int` (multiple values allowed)  
  **Example:** `1 2 3 4`

## Examples

### Basic Example with CSV File

`python speedy.py -n 2 -k 16 -csv test_set.csv`

This example processes values from the `test_set.csv` file.

## Output

The script processes the input values based on the provided parameters and prints the smallest value along with the total execution time in nanoseconds.

# Speedy_max.cpp, Speedy_min.cpp, Speedy_x86.cpp

## Compilation

### Install a C++ Compiler

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Common options include GCC (for Linux and macOS) or MSVC (for Windows). On Linux or macOS, you can install GCC using a package manager (apt, yum, brew, etc.). On Windows, you can install Visual Studio with the C++ development tools.

### Compile the program

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your program.cpp file is saved.

Use the following command to compile your program: g++ -o program program.cpp

### Run the Executable

After the compilation is successful, run the program by typing the following command: ./program -n <total_elements> -k <elements_in_permutation> -csv <csv_file_path>

## Usage

After compiling the program, you can run the executable from the command line using the following format:

`./program -n <total_elements> -k <elements_in_permutation> -csv <csv_file_path>`

### Arguments

- **`-n:`** (Required) The total number of elements.  
  **Type:** `int`  
  **Example:** `-n 100`

- **`-k:`** (Required) The number of elements in the permutation.  
  **Type:** `int`  
  **Example:** `-k 5`

- **`-csv:`** (Optional) Path to the CSV file containing values to process.  
  **Type:** `string`  
  **Example:** `-csv path/to/values.csv`

### Example

To execute the program with 100 total elements, 5 elements in the permutation, and a CSV file named `data.csv`:

`./program -n 100 -k 5 -csv data.csv`

This command will process the values provided in the `data.csv` file, find the smallest value, reverse-engineer it, and display the result along with the total execution time in nanoseconds.

### Output

The program will output the smallest value from the provided data along with the total execution time measured in nanoseconds.



## Set Generation Script

### Features

- Generates permutations for a given base `n` and exponent `k`.
- Randomizes the order of the generated permutations.
- Saves the randomized set to a CSV file (`test_set.csv`).

### Usage

Run the set generation script from the command line using the following format:


python3 gen.py -n <base_number> -k <exponent>


## Applications

This approach can be applied to various NP-complete decision problems, including:

1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
2. Knapsack Problem
3. Graph Coloring
4. Hamiltonian Cycle Problem

## Future Work

- Extend the approach to other NP-complete decision problems
- Explore real-world applications in logistics, supply chain optimization, and network design
- Investigate integration with quantum computing
- Develop dedicated hardware to enhance performance
